# REX_2022

Tasks for upcoming week:
- Revise and improve the details of the abstract (A & A)
- Try to write up the template for the remaining paragraphs in the paper such as methodology, can leave the data empty for now (A & A)
- Write workflow (Z & P)
- Data Collection for both normal and abnormal ppl (Z & P)
- Deepface speed optimization (Z & P)
- pandas dataframe for filtering data (Z & P)
- machine learning using decision tree algorithm with sklearn framework (my friend)
- result and conclusion in statistical meaning (Anna & my friend) (edited) 



DONE:
- Have meeting in the weekend to finalize the literature review.
- Research topic: Can we use online pictures and videos to detect early symptoms of motor disorders in patients? 
- Approach: Can we compare the accuracy with facial expression recognition in normal people, and use it as an indicator of the risk first?
- Provide research literature review, will need to submit it to REX on next week.
- Find out the limitation of the current research.

Parkinson related:

Limitation of facial recognition in Parkinson's:
1. factors like age-related differences, cultural differences and the method of data analysis can affect recognizing and predicting PD in facial expression processing. (possible solution: instead of recognizing a particular disease, we can predict a more generic mental disorder disease based on the evaluation.)

2. facial expressions are highly correlated to the severity of the disease. Patients with PD often show dull expressions in the middle and late stage.
