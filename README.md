# REX_2022

Tasks for upcoming week:
- Research topic: Can we use online pictures and videos to detect early symptoms of motor disorders in patients? 
- Research topic: Can we compare the accuracy with facial expression recognition in normal people, and use it as an indicator of the risk first?
- Provide research literature review, will need to submit it to REX on next week.
- Find out the limitation of the current research.

Limitation of facial recognition in Parkinson's:
1. factors like age-related differences, cultural differences and the method of data analysis can affect recognizing and predicting PD in facial expression processing.

2. facial expressions are highly correlated to the severity of the disease. Patients with PD often show dull expressions in the middle and late stage.
